      <div class="bio-body">Cliff grew up in a little town in southeastern North Dakota called Hankinson.  He graduated from high school with honors in 1969. By the middle of the first summer out of high school he acquired his first job with Melroe Mfg in Gwinner, ND.  Ever since then, he has been interested in making things. A few years later, he ended up in Fremont, NE. While he was there he worked for Stormor Grain Bins.  By the end of the summer of 1971 he found himself on the way to Minneapolis, MN.  While in Minneapolis, Cliff's life began to take shape.  He worked for many companies.  His favorite was Rosemount Aerospace.  There he had the opportunity to make parts for the aviation industry.  He worked on programs like the NASA space shuttle and the B1 bomber.  Eventually cliff changed careers and became a programmer.
